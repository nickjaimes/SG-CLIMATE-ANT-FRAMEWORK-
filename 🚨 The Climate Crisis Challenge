Current Limitations in Climate Modeling:

· Coarse Resolution: Global models miss local impacts
· Computational Limits: Can't simulate complex feedback loops
· Uncertainty Propagation: Small errors amplify over decades
· Siloed Approaches: Disconnected mitigation strategies
· Delayed Feedback: Policies implemented too late
